TASK-1
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION :
CODES EXPLONATION
Logical Flow: The code follows a clear and logical sequence, from loading the data to visualizing the results.
Standard Preprocessing: You’ve applied standard preprocessing techniques like train-test splitting and feature scaling, which are essential for ensuring that the model performs well.
Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest is a robust and widely used classifier that generally provides good results with minimal tuning.
Model Evaluation: You’ve included both a confusion matrix and a classification report, which provide comprehensive insights into the model's performance.
Visualization: The heatmap of the confusion matrix is a great addition, making it easier to interpret the classification results.
